# Smart Crop Field Protection & Automated Irrigation

**Description:**  
This project is an IoT-based smart irrigation system designed to automate water flow in agricultural fields. It includes real-time soil moisture sensing, water pump control, and security features to protect the field from intrusions.

**Tech Stack:**  
- Arduino UNO  
- Soil Moisture Sensor  
- Ultrasonic Sensor  
- Relay Module  
- Water Pump  
- Buzzer  
- Jumper wires & Breadboard

**Features:**  
- Automatic irrigation based on soil moisture level  
- Field protection using motion detection  
- Buzzer alert system  
- Low power consumption design

**How it Works:**  
The system continuously checks soil moisture. If the soil is dry, it activates the water pump. If an obstacle is detected (like an animal or human), a buzzer is triggered to scare it away and send a alert message to the owner of the filed via sms.

**Circuit Diagram:**  
circuit diagram available in 'circuit_diagram' image file.

**Code:**  
The Arduino code is available in `main.ino` file.
